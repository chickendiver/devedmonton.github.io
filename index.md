## DevelopEd, August 16-17th 2019

**Do you care about the software development scene in Edmonton? This is your chance to get involved and make it better!**

[80% SOLD OUT! RSVP NOW!!](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/developed-tickets-63570025658?ref=estw)

DevelopEd provides a unique face-to-face venue to kick start new sustainable projects throughout the rest of the year. The success of the event will be measured in terms of what was accomplished, not what was planned or discussed, so come prepared to roll up your sleeves.

Friday night attendees gather, socialize and start planning, then Saturday we hit the ground hard at 9am by pitching project ideas then spending the day building them before sharing our progress on Saturday night. Though attendees will be pitching and matching up with projects on Saturday, some ideas already shared include:

1. A local platform for matching mentors / mentees
2. A platform for matching causes and problems requiring developer help, with developers looking to practice their skills and support the community
3. Building a plug-and-play event recording box (headless OBS and an Intel NUC perhaps?)
4. Creating an RFP/RFC process for kickstarting DES initiatives throughout the year

We're also looking for sponsors to help provide food and other materials to the attendees. Becoming a sponsor is a great way to raise your companies profile, connect with potential employees, and to shape the direction of Edmonton's development community. We offer gold, silver, and bronze level sponsorship packages so there's an option for every budget.

We're planning everything in the open in the #dev-edmonton-society channel on our Slack, and in [our planning document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gedIjOOoAM_ZCIqUATUVpSk5TfLRKttQhb6uNwk0A_Q/edit?usp=sharing). If you want to help out then hop on Slack and speak up, or pick a task from the top of the planning doc and put your name next to it.
