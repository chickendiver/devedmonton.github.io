## DevelopEd, August 16-17th 2019 (SOLD OUT!)

DevelopEd provides a unique face-to-face venue to kick start new sustainable projects throughout the rest of the year. The success of the event will be measured in terms of what was accomplished, not what was planned or discussed, so come prepared to roll up your sleeves.
