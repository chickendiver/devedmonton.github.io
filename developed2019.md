## DevelopEd, August 16-17th 2019

**TICKETS FOR 2019 ARE SOLD OUT**

DevelopEd brings Edmonton's developer community together to solve problems that matter. Built with the spirit of inclusivity, the event encourages developers and community members of all backgrounds and skill levels to do great things together.

This unique face-to-face venue is a spring board to kickstart new sustainable projects throughout the rest of the year. Success will be measured in terms of what was accomplished, not what was planned or discussed, so come prepared to roll up your sleeves!

A huge thank you to DotDash and all our other [TODO! generous sponsors](), without whom this event wouldn't be possible!

### Format

This is a new kind of event for organizers and attendees, which we're tentatively calling an **OrgJam**.

Friday night attendees gather, socialize and start planning, then Saturday we pitch ideas and hit the ground running. After a long day spent building awesome projects, we gather in the evening to share and celebrate our creations!
